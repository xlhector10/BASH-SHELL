## Get It Game

You're the good pointer "*" who was stripper off of it's dreams by witches, so you have to catch of those you can, your dreams are represented by "the dream pointer (^)".

Use to move:
  * (w) or (UpArrow) To go up.
  * (a) or (LeftArrow) To go Left.
  * (s) or (DownArrow) To go down.
  * (d) or (RightArrow) To go Right.
  
But you have to be careful because time is running down, every time you catch at the dream pointer "^"  
you'll gain some seconds, but there's other risk arroud, every 5 times you catch at the dream pointer "^"
map will increase it's size, then the dream pointer will apear far from your ubication.

It will be ease at start but it is getting harder progressively. GoodLuck ;)
